# Jeep-Command
This game aims to resemble the Jeep Command of the Commodore 64 era. 

It is played via the keyboard.

I've found the music from Lemon: http://www.lemon64.com/?mainurl=http%3A//www.lemon64.com/games/details.php%3FID%3D1359

and I've converted from SID to WAV using SID2WAV of http://www.vgmpf.com/Wiki/index.php/SID_to_WAV
