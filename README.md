# Jeep-Command
This game aims to resemble the "Jeep Command" of the Commodore 64. 

It is played via the keyboard.

I've found the music from Lemon: http://www.lemon64.com/?mainurl=http%3A//www.lemon64.com/games/details.php%3FID%3D1359

and I've converted from SID to WAV using SID2WAV of http://www.vgmpf.com/Wiki/index.php/SID_to_WAV

Some personal notes:
I considered starting Python programming with Pooyan. Then decided to go with a horizontal scroller. Pooyan is another great game, but the Jeep Command has more adrenaline. The bad thing with Jeep Command is the need to remember what's coming up (memorizing the scenes). It's not like solving small puzzles continuously, but rather trying to optimize the moves as you loose. The good thing is, it helps you restart from where you left off.
