# THIS GAME IS IN DEVELOPMENT STAGE

# Jeep Command
This game aims to resemble the "Jeep Command" of the Commodore 64. 

The game is played via the keyboard.

Some personal notes:
This is my first code in Python! I've decided to learn Python as a hobby. After a quick search I've found a "moving_platforms" code, which I started as my sprites and game code base.

I considered starting Python game programming with Pooyan. Then decided to go with a horizontal scroller. Btw, Pooyan is another great game, but the Jeep Command has a bit more adrenaline!

I've put together my initial working code, and you can already enjoy 2-3 seconds of gameplay. :)

I've not used the original soundtrack. I'll upload that one later on.

You can listen to the original background music here: Lemon: http://www.lemon64.com/?mainurl=http%3A//www.lemon64.com/games/details.php%3FID%3D1359

I've converted from SID to WAV using SID2WAV of http://www.vgmpf.com/Wiki/index.php/SID_to_WAV

Happy coding everyone!
