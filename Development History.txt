After two weeks, I've coded approx. 4-5 short sessions and worked on the Jeep sprite for 20 minutes. Now I can see the Player sprite (which is a Jeep image), and the background music is working. Game mechanics is not done yet. (It's a platformer right now)

I've not decided to upload onto GitHub yet. Should I upload and keep a copy there, yet? I think it would be better to have something resembling the Jeep a bit more, maybe the small bushes? and the first jump? maybe a cyclic track? Whatever, I uploaded it already, AS IS.

I think I can keep this history file on GitHub, too.

+ added SPACE to Jump.

+ added Jeep.png (edited from a screenshot of an emulated game)

+ as of now, it is 2-second length game, try to get out of the scene!

TODO: make the level longer, maybe in an infinite loop...

I've used a tutorial code (MovingPlatform.py) and added a constant minimum x-velocity to the player.

The level obstacles are not displayed at the moment. To be fixed.

Bg music is there.
