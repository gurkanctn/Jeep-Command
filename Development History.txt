After another session, I've learned how to place rectangular items on the level. Have designed a three block level, which teaches the basics of jump.

Conclusion: the collision detection is rectangular, so it doesn't look that much realistic, as the tires are in the air until the bumper leaves the block. This might need to be improved, although not a show stopper.

TODO: 
[] firing mechanism
[] a background with random clouds?
[] longer level, how long can it be? 10000 = 10000px / 6 (px/frame) /60fps = 27.75 seconds

After two weeks, I've coded approx. 4-5 short sessions and worked on the Jeep sprite for 20 minutes. Now I can see the Player sprite (which is a Jeep image), and the background music is working. Game mechanics is not done yet. (It's a platformer right now)

I've not decided to upload onto GitHub yet. Should I upload and keep a copy there, yet? I think it would be better to have something resembling the Jeep a bit more, maybe the small bushes? and the first jump? maybe a cyclic track? Whatever, I uploaded it already, AS IS.

I think I can keep this history file on GitHub, too.

+ added SPACE to Jump.

+ added Jeep.png (edited from a screenshot of an emulated game)

+ as of now, it is 2-second length game, try to get out of the scene!

TODO: make the level longer, maybe in an infinite loop...

I've used a tutorial code (MovingPlatform.py) and added a constant minimum x-velocity to the player.

The level obstacles are not displayed at the moment. To be fixed.

Bg music is there.
